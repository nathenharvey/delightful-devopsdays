# Delightful DevOps Days

This year marks the seventh anniversary of the first DevOps Days event. The format of the events has been fairly consistent from one DevOps Days to the next. This may be your first DevOps Days or your fifth. In fact, this may be your first technical event ever. So, how did we get here and how can you make the most of the next two days? Let’s look back on the history of DevOps through the eyes of someone who’s been a community participant from the early days of the movement. As we do so, we’ll look at some tips you can takeaway to help make sure your DevOps Days DFW experience is delightful. Be prepared to learn, be prepared to make new friends, and, most importantly, be prepared to be surprised.
